### Day 1: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**:write first tests for a game called fizzbuzz

**Thoughts:** Fisrt day kicked off with a bang. Admitted by ignorance around TDD (test driven development) and asked for help. Got paired with Lewis - he might not be more experienced than me (he is only a few weeks into Makers Academy) but he knew more about me re: TDD. I followed him stepby-small-step to write tests and write fizzbuzz 

**Learnings:**
- save beginner concepts for Meetups
- break the tests down as small as possible. Each test should relate to one tiny bit of functionality

**Tomorrow:** continue writing tests for fizzbuzz
-------------------------------
### Day 2: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished fizzbuzz functionality

**Thoughts:** writing tests led me to write the code for the program in a way I wouldn't have otherwise, because of the order/structure of my tests. It's not very read-able but it does work!

**Learnings:**
- tests can get you to make a functional program, but refactoring is required after to make code elegant. And because you've written tests for everything, if you make a mistake whilst refactoring, tests will let you know! 
- learnt about require and require_relative (made a note on Google Keep)

**Tomorrow:**
- look at [Makers academy blog](https://blog.makersacademy.com/an-introduction-to-tdd-in-ruby-72f0a8536509) and:
  - refactor your code according to the red-green-refactor principle
  - do the last challenge at the end
  
  -------------------------------
### Day 3: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: solved some of the game engine maths for Algebra Jungle 

**Thoughts:** Didn't get get nearly as much coding as I wanted to get done. Mostly maths logic for 'balance' in game. Frustrating, but even Steven couldn't solve the problem at the heart of the balance mechanic.

**Learnings:** Not much learning unfortunately, except take more breaks when thinking about a problem.

**Tomorrow:** see Day 2 entry.

-------------------------------
### Day 4-5: November 24-25, 2017

**Progress**: Completed Makers challenge on TDD. Read about Chrome extensions

**Thoughts:** The Makers academy challenge was surprisingly straight forward. It was fun messing around with Ruby's built-in classes. Chrome extensions on the other hand are a bit more complicated. I feel like I need more basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge before jumping into the chrome extension, because at the moment, I can't read the examples given by [Google Developers' guides](https://youtu.be/e3McMaHvlBY?list=PLCA101D6A85FE9D4B). Freecodecamp might be a way through this, ie to develop my front-end knowledge

**Learnings:**
- Stating an in-built class in Ruby and then defining a new method inside it will mena you can call that method on any object of that class.
- Chrom extensions use a mixture of HTML/CSS/JS

**Tomorrow:** work through Freecodecamp

-------------------------------
### Day 12: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** Doing Freecodecamp is really nice, but I still feel like I need a project. Maybe at the end I should aim for some sort of portfolio page?

**Learnings:** HTML has two layout concepts called element, margin and padding. Element is a chunk of content - each will have its own border. Margin is the space between different elements (eg if a box (element) sits within another box (another element), the margin is the space bewteen the former's border and the latter's border). Padding is the space between the element and its own border (eg a text box with lots of padding will have a lot of space between its text (element) and its box border). 

**Tomorrow:** 
- Do some more Freecodecamp - work out a project
- Look at user input for TDD

-------------------------------
### Day 13: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Finally understand what people mean by Bootstrp. I'm a bit ill today, so only did around 45-50 mins rather than full hour.

**Learnings:**
- Bootsrap is a like a library of premade CSS classes that you can add to elements
- some of Bootsrap classes have to be added to div sections that house each element you want to apply Bootsrap to. For eg, if you want adjust relative size of an button by using the 'col-xs-4' class, the button needs to be within a div section, and the class 'col-xs-4' is applied to the div. Otherwise, othert classes like 'btn-primary' can be applied to the <button> element itself  

**Tomorrow:**
- carry on with Freecodecamp
- look at user input for TDD
