### Day 1: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**:write first tests for a game called fizzbuzz

**Thoughts:** Fisrt day kicked off with a bang. Admitted by ignorance around TDD (test driven development) and asked for help. Got paired with Lewis - he might not be more experienced than me (he is only a few weeks into Makers Academy) but he knew more about me re: TDD. I followed him stepby-small-step to write tests and write fizzbuzz 

**Learnings:**
- save beginner concepts for Meetups
- break the tests down as small as possible. Each test should relate to one tiny bit of functionality

**Tomorrow:** continue writing tests for fizzbuzz
-------------------------------
### Day 2: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished fizzbuzz functionality

**Thoughts:** writing tests led me to write the code for the program in a way I wouldn't have otherwise, because of the order/structure of my tests. It's not very read-able but it does work!

**Learnings:**
- tests can get you to make a functional program, but refactoring is required after to make code elegant. And because you've written tests for everything, if you make a mistake whilst refactoring, tests will let you know! 
- learnt about require and require_relative (made a note on Google Keep)

**Tomorrow:**
- look at [Makers academy blog](https://blog.makersacademy.com/an-introduction-to-tdd-in-ruby-72f0a8536509) and:
  - refactor your code according to the red-green-refactor principle
  - do the last challenge at the end
  
  -------------------------------
### Day 3: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: solved some of the game engine maths for Algebra Jungle 

**Thoughts:** Didn't get get nearly as much coding as I wanted to get done. Mostly maths logic for 'balance' in game. Frustrating, but even Steven couldn't solve the problem at the heart of the balance mechanic.

**Learnings:** Not much learning unfortunately, except take more breaks when thinking about a problem.

**Tomorrow:** see Day 2 entry.

-------------------------------
### Day 4-5: November 24-25, 2017

**Progress**: Completed Makers challenge on TDD. Read about Chrome extensions

**Thoughts:** The Makers academy challenge was surprisingly straight forward. It was fun messing around with Ruby's built-in classes. Chrome extensions on the other hand are a bit more complicated. I feel like I need more basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge before jumping into the chrome extension, because at the moment, I can't read the examples given by [Google Developers' guides](https://youtu.be/e3McMaHvlBY?list=PLCA101D6A85FE9D4B). Freecodecamp might be a way through this, ie to develop my front-end knowledge

**Learnings:**
- Stating an in-built class in Ruby and then defining a new method inside it will mena you can call that method on any object of that class.
- Chrom extensions use a mixture of HTML/CSS/JS

**Tomorrow:** work through Freecodecamp
