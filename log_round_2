### Day 1: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**:write first tests for a game called fizzbuzz

**Thoughts:** Fisrt day kicked off with a bang. Admitted by ignorance around TDD (test driven development) and asked for help. Got paired with Lewis - he might not be more experienced than me (he is only a few weeks into Makers Academy) but he knew more about me re: TDD. I followed him stepby-small-step to write tests and write fizzbuzz 

**Learnings:**
- save beginner concepts for Meetups
- break the tests down as small as possible. Each test should relate to one tiny bit of functionality

**Tomorrow:** continue writing tests for fizzbuzz
-------------------------------
### Day 2: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished fizzbuzz

**Thoughts:** writing tests led me to write the code for the program in a way I wouldn't have otherwise, because of the order/structure of my tests. It's not very read-able but it does work!

**Learnings:**
- tests can get you to make a functional program, but refactoring is required after to make code elegant. And because you've written tests for everything, if you make a mistake whilst refactoring, tests will let you know! 
- learnt about require and require_relative (made a note on Google Keep)

**Tomorrow:**
- look at: https://blog.makersacademy.com/an-introduction-to-tdd-in-ruby-72f0a8536509 and:
  - refactor your code according to the red-green-refactor principle
  - do the last challenge at the end
