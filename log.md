# 100 Days Of Code - Log

------------ Example -------------------
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

------------ Example -------------------
### Day 1: August 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a script that extracts the content of a webpage in HTML format.

**Thoughts:** This was the hardest day of coding by far, ironically. I just couldn't find the relevant gem to extract data from a webpage - it's taken me like 4 hours! I eventually came across Nokogiri gem which does the job. Also used github for the first time. Not sure how I'm going to store scripts and projects here as I progress, but I'm sure it'll become clear!

**Learnings:**
- use The [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) for finding relevant gems (they are ranked!)
- there isn't always a simple, easy-to-understand gem to get what you want. Sometimes you'll just need to copy & paste.
