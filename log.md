# 100 Days Of Code - Log

------------ Example -------------------
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a script that extracts the content of a webpage in HTML format.

**Thoughts:** This was the hardest day of coding by far, ironically. I just couldn't find the relevant gem to extract data from a webpage - it's taken me like 4 hours! I eventually came across Nokogiri gem which does the job. Also used github for the first time. Not sure how I'm going to store scripts and projects here as I progress, but I'm sure it'll become clear!

**Learnings:**
- use The [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) for finding relevant gems (they are ranked!)
- there isn't always a simple, easy-to-understand gem to get what you want. Sometimes you'll just need to copy & paste (eg to get the Nokogiri gem to work (and download a webpage's html) I had to use [this solution](https://gist.github.com/fnichol/867550))

### Day 2: August 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a script that sends tweets.

**Thoughts:** A lot of messing with Gems again, but this time I just copied and pasted rather than dive into the abyss. I can now interact with the Twitter API which is amazing. I've been copying and pasting snippets of code and simply running them a bit aimlessly; they work fine, but I'll need to actually understand how the snippets work so I can start calling up data that I want.

**Learnings:**
- Using gems doesn't hand me what I want on a platter. I still need to understand the commands in order to manipulate it and get what i want
- without a specific task (eg retrieving a specific tweet), I tend to be a bit aimless in my learning.
